      Your randomly selected payoffs rounds in the first game were: round {{ payoffround1 }} and round {{ payoffround2 }}.
    </p>
    <p>
      In round {{ payoffround1 }} your payoff was: {{ payoff1 }}
    </p>
    <p>
      In round {{ payoffround2 }} your payoff was: {{ payoff2 }}
    </p>
    <p>
      Your randomly selected payoffs rounds in the second game were: round {{ payoffround3 }} and round {{ payoffround4 }}.
    </p>
    <p>
      In round {{ payoffround3 }} your payoff was: {{ payoff3 }}
    </p>
    <p>
      In round {{ payoffround4 }} your payoff was: {{ payoff4 }}
    </p>
    <p>
      In total, you earned {{ player.payoff }}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since each point is worth $1/ (2 * {{ subsession.OPPONENTS }}), your earnings, rounded to the nearest dollar, is ${{ variablepay }} for your preformance in the experiment. Added to the ${{ fixedpay }} show up fee, your total payout for the experiment is ${{ player.earnings }}.
